   /*  

   PostgreSQL arrays are very powerful, and GIN indexing support makes them efficient to work with. Nonetheless, itâ€™s still not so efficient that we would replace a lookup table with an array in situations where we do a lot of lookups.

Also, some PostgreSQL array functions show a quadratic behavior: looping over array elements is inefficient, so learn to use unnest() instead and filter elements with a where clause. If we see ourselves doing that a lot, it might be a good sign that we really needed a lookup table!
